    Coffee is a plant <span class="darkness">(Coffea)</span> and the name of the drink that is made from this plant. <br/> The coffee plant is a bush or tree that can grow up to ten meters (about 32 feet) <br/> high, but is usually cut shorter. Coffee plants originally grew in Africa, and now <br/> also grow in South America, Central America and Southeast Asia and despite <br/> the bans imposed during the 15th century by religious leaders in Mecca  and  <br/> Cairo,  and later by the Catholic Church.
